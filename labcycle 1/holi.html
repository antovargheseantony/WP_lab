<b>Holi is one of the major festivals of Hindus. It is celebrated in South Asian countries, espe-cially in India and Nepal. Holi is the festival of colors. The festival is celebrated for two to three days.Holi is celebrated in the spring season. Hindus believe that spring is full of colors so they throw colored water on each other<p align="justify">Holi is based on a legend about King Hiran-yakaship. `Hiranyakashyap had a son, Prahlad. Prahlad was the greatest devotee of Lord Vishnu. Hiranyakashyap wanted to kill his son, so he called his sister, Holika. She had a magic robe. This robe had the power to save the wearer from burning in fire. Hiranyakashyap ordered his sister to sit on a burning fire along with Prahlad. He thought that his sister would not be harmed by the fire because of the magic robe and Prahlad would be burnt to death. But the result was the opposite to what the evil demon king planned.</p><b>
